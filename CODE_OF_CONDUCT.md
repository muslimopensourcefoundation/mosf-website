# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Foundation

This Code of Conduct is guided by Islamic ethical principles (Akhlaq), including justice (Adl), compassion (Rahmah), respect for human dignity, and the protection of honor and rights. We believe in creating a community where all individuals are treated with fairness, kindness, and respect, regardless of their background or beliefs.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, guided by principles of justice, mercy, and mutual respect.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback with humility
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Giving others the benefit of the doubt and assuming good intentions
* Seeking reconciliation and forgiveness when conflicts arise
* Protecting the honor and dignity of all community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Backbiting, gossip, slander, or spreading harmful rumors about others
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Violating the privacy or confidentiality of others
* Dishonesty, deception, or breaking commitments
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting or contrary to ethical principles

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior with justice and fairness. We commit to:

* Investigating all reports thoroughly and impartially, giving all parties an opportunity to be heard
* Seeking reconciliation and understanding before taking corrective action when appropriate
* Applying consequences with justice, considering the context and circumstances
* Ensuring decisions are made fairly, without favoritism or prejudice

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that violate our standards, always striving to act with justice and compassion.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **beder.bourahmah@muslimopensource.org**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. An apology may be requested, and we encourage both parties to seek reconciliation and understanding.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Resolution and Reconciliation

We believe in the value of forgiveness and reconciliation. When violations occur, we encourage:
* Private discussion and understanding before public consequences
* Sincere apologies and forgiveness when appropriate
* Opportunities for growth and redemption
* Mediation when disputes arise

Our goal is not merely punishment, but the restoration of trust and the strengthening of our community through justice, compassion, and mutual respect.
