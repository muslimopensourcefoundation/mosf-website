    "alignment": { "score": 9, "comment": "Directly advances Islamic knowledge, software education, or ethical technology in a public and transparent way. The project promotes community learning and digital access to Islamic content through its open-source da'wah tools. By enabling creation of captioned Quranic videos with translations in 40+ languages, it serves the global Muslim community and supports Islamic education. Strong alignment with MOSF's mission of open Islamic knowledge and ethical technology." },
    "openness": { "score": 3, "comment": "Project uses Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0), which is a non-commercial license. This restricts legal reuse to non-commercial purposes only, making it source-available rather than truly open-source. The license explicitly prohibits commercial use, derivative works for commercial purposes, and limits redistribution. While the source code is accessible and the project is actively developed, the non-commercial restriction significantly limits the openness that MOSF values. Contributor guidance documentation (CONTRIBUTING.md) is also not present." },
    "liveness": { "score": 10, "comment": "Exceptionally active maintained community project with regular commits, recent releases, and visible responsiveness. Repository shows 1,005 commits and 71 releases, with latest release (v3.2.2) on November 9, 2025. Regular release cadence and continuous development demonstrate strong stewardship and an active roadmap. This level of activity clearly indicates a healthy, actively maintained project." },
    "value": { "score": 9, "comment": "High technical and educational value with innovative approach. Professional-grade video editor specifically designed for Quranic content introduces valuable patterns for Islamic media creation. Advanced features including multi-language subtitle support (40+ languages), Arabic text rendering, and extensive customization options demonstrate scalability and technical sophistication. The project addresses a real need in Islamic media creation and education, making it valuable to others in the community." },
    "docs": { "score": 7, "comment": "Basic README and install guide present in repository with partial explanation of setup and usage. README provides project overview, screenshots, developer setup instructions, and notes about required binaries (ffmpeg, ffprobe, yt-dlp). Release notes are well-maintained with detailed changelogs. The project maintains comprehensive documentation on its website (qurancaption.com/documentation) including video tutorials, installation guides, project management, subtitle creation, styling, and export instructions. However, this documentation is not in the repository, which limits transparency and community contribution. Documentation lacks API documentation for developers and accessibility awareness (RTL, screen readers, multilingual considerations). Minimal multilingual support in repository documentation itself, though the application supports 40+ languages." },
    "community": { "score": 6, "comment": "Some openness to contribution but limited processes. Active Discord community mentioned in README indicates community engagement exists. Repository shows modest community metrics (32 stars, 6 forks) with occasional PRs possible. However, governance documentation (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is not present, and there are no visible issue/PR templates. Community stewardship exists but lacks structured governance processes that would facilitate collaboration." },
    "ethics": { "score": 9, "comment": "Exemplary ethical alignment clearly guided by Islamic principles, transparency, and public benefit. Project serves a clear beneficial purpose by making Quranic content more accessible to the global Muslim community. Transparent development process, honest presentation of features, and focus on public benefit without harmful monetization. Upholds honesty, justice, and community service. No ethical concerns identified. Project promotes Islamic knowledge sharing through ethical technology." }

  "summary": "Quran Caption is a professional video editor designed specifically for creating captioned videos of Quranic recitations with translations in 40+ languages. The project demonstrates exceptional liveness with over 1,000 commits and 71 releases, including a recent v3.2.2 release. It serves a clear Islamic educational purpose and shows strong technical value. The project maintains comprehensive documentation on its website, though it is not present in the repository. However, the project uses a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license, which restricts commercial use and limits true open-source collaboration. Moving documentation to the repository, adopting an OSI-approved open-source license, and more visible governance structures would elevate it to Model Repository status.",
  "narrative": [
    "Quran Caption addresses a specific need in Islamic media creation: transforming Quranic recitations into professional, captioned videos that can be shared across platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. The project's focus on accessibility through multi-language translations (40+) demonstrates a commitment to serving the global Muslim community.",
    "The repository shows exceptional vitality with 1,005 commits and 71 releases, including a very recent v3.2.2 release in November 2025. This level of activity indicates strong stewardship and continuous improvement. The project has evolved through multiple major versions, with Version 3 representing a complete UI/UX redesign and enhanced capabilities.",
    "Built with modern technologies (Svelte, TypeScript, Rust) using the Tauri framework, Quran Caption demonstrates technical sophistication. The desktop application approach provides users with powerful local processing capabilities while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.",
    "The project maintains comprehensive documentation on its website (qurancaption.com/documentation) including video tutorials, installation guides, and detailed instructions for creating and styling Quranic videos. However, this documentation is hosted externally rather than in the repository, which limits transparency and community contribution opportunities. While the project has an active Discord community and demonstrates transparency through public development, it uses a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license, which restricts commercial use and limits the openness that MOSF values. The non-commercial restriction prevents the project from being truly open-source according to OSI standards. The project could benefit from adopting an OSI-approved license (such as GPL, MIT, or Apache), moving documentation to the repository, more visible governance documentation, and contributor guidance. The modest star/fork count (32/6) may not fully reflect the project's value, suggesting potential for increased community engagement with better repository-based documentation and outreach."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Adopt an OSI-approved open-source license (such as GPL v3, MIT, Apache, or BSD) to replace the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license. This would enable true open-source collaboration and align with MOSF's values of openness and shared knowledge.",
    "Add explicit CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files to establish clear governance and encourage community contributions.",
    "Move or mirror the comprehensive website documentation (qurancaption.com/documentation) into the repository to improve transparency and enable community contributions. Add API documentation for developers.",
    "Create a roadmap or project board to communicate future development plans and priorities.",
    "Add accessibility documentation and considerations for users with different needs (RTL support, screen readers, multilingual documentation).",
    "Consider adding issue and PR templates to facilitate community engagement and bug reporting.",
    "Document the translation integration process and how new languages can be added."
