  "summary": "The official Quran.com frontend is one of the most impactful Muslim-led open web projects, demonstrating technical excellence and community stewardship. However, the absence of a clear open-source license prevents it from achieving 'Model Repository' status.",
  "narrative": [
    "Built with Next.js and TypeScript, the Quran.com frontend powers one of the internet's most visited Qur'an platforms, offering translations, tafsīr access, and a smooth multilingual experience.",
    "Its engineering quality, modular design system, Storybook integration, and CI pipelines, shows maturity and reliability seldom matched in religious open technology projects.",
    "The primary limitation is the lack of an explicit license file, which restricts derivative educational or collaborative reuse despite otherwise exemplary openness."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add an explicit LICENSE file (MIT, BSD, or Apache) to legally open the source.",
    "Publish an accessibility checklist for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.",
    "Maintain a lightweight public roadmap or release changelog."
