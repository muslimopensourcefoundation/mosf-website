Git history shows 34 commits since project inception (November 15, 2025), with the most recent commit on November 18, 2025, demonstrating intensive recent development activity. The project has 1 primary contributor (Abduselam Shaltu). The project is marked as WIP (Work in Progress) but shows strong signs of active development: comprehensive ROADMAP.md tracking current status and future features, GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows for automated testing and releases, unit test suite, and detailed CONTRIBUTING.md. The project has a Homebrew formula for distribution, indicating release management. While GitHub shows limited community engagement metrics (3 stars, 0 forks, 0 open issues as of evaluation), the commit history demonstrates regular, recent development activity and active maintenance, meeting the criteria for 'Active' development."

    "value": {
      "score": 9,
      "comment": "High technical and educational value with innovative approach. The project is a sophisticated C++/FFmpeg-based tool that introduces valuable patterns for Islamic media creation. It demonstrates technical sophistication through: advanced Arabic text rendering with HarfBuzz for proper shaping, multi-language translation support with localization, custom audio processing with VTT/SRT timing support, intelligent caching systems, parallel processing optimizations, hardware acceleration support, and comprehensive video generation pipeline. The tool addresses a real need in Islamic media creation and education, providing both gapped (ayah-by-ayah) and gapless (continuous) workflows. The architecture is well-structured with modular components (text layout engine, subtitle builder, audio processor, etc.), making it valuable as both a tool and a learning resource."

    "docs": {
      "score": 8,
      "comment": "Comprehensive documentation with clear setup instructions and examples. The README provides detailed installation guides for multiple platforms (macOS, Ubuntu/Debian), prerequisites, build instructions, quick start examples, comprehensive command-line option documentation, configuration explanations, and performance benchmarks. CONTRIBUTING.md includes detailed contribution guidelines, code style guidance, templates for bug reports and enhancements, and specific instructions for adding new languages/translations. ROADMAP.md provides transparent project status tracking. The documentation demonstrates accessibility awareness through multi-language support considerations and RTL text handling (though Urdu RTL rendering is noted as a known bug). However, API documentation for developers could be more extensive, and some advanced features could benefit from more detailed examples. The documentation is well-organized and ready for educational reuse."

    "community": {
      "score": 6,
      "comment": "Developing community with good foundation but very limited current engagement. The project has excellent CONTRIBUTING.md with clear templates for bug reports, enhancement suggestions, and pull requests. It includes a Code of Conduct section within CONTRIBUTING.md (though not a separate CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file). The project demonstrates openness to contribution with detailed guidelines, priority areas for contributions, and clear development setup instructions. However, GitHub shows minimal community engagement (3 stars, 0 forks, 0 issues, 0 pull requests as of evaluation), indicating the project is in early stages or has low visibility. The project lacks a separate CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file, and there are no visible issue/PR templates in a .github folder (though templates are documented in CONTRIBUTING.md). The foundation for strong community stewardship is present through documentation, but actual community participation is currently minimal, and structured governance processes could be more visible."

    "ethics": {
      "score": 10,
      "comment": "Exemplary ethical and faith alignment. The project is clearly guided by Islamic principles, transparency, and public benefit. CONTRIBUTING.md explicitly states guiding principles including sincerity (seeking Allah's pleasure), humbleness, educational focus, distraction-free design, shirk-free content, accessibility, and quality. The project's mission statement emphasizes helping users seek tawbah and draw closer to Allah. The README concludes with a dua (supplication): 'May Allah accept this work and make it a means of drawing closer to Him. Ameen.' The project serves a clear beneficial purpose by making Quranic content accessible to the global Muslim community and beyond. Transparent development process, honest presentation of features (including WIP status and known bugs), and focus on public benefit without harmful monetization. Upholds honesty, justice, and community service throughout."
