  "summary": "The Quranic Audio repository provides the code behind the quranicaudio.com experience with an MIT license and practical setup instructions. It is a solid fit for MOSF's mission, although the project would benefit from renewed maintenance and clearer stewardship.",
  "narrative": [
    "This repository powers the Quranic Audio experience and includes a working Postgres schema and npm-based build workflow. The code and data bootstrap steps make it a useful learning reference for audio delivery projects.",
    "Activity has slowed in recent years. The latest tagged release dates back to 2019 and there are many open PRs and issues, which suggests limited maintenance despite ongoing user interest.",
    "With a small round of maintenance, a new tagged release, and clearer contribution processes, the project could serve as a strong foundation for community-led improvements."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Land small maintenance updates, tag a new release, and add a short CHANGELOG.",
    "Triage and template issues and PRs, then publish a minimal public roadmap.",
    "Add accessibility notes and more detailed deployment guidance for the DB-backed setup."
