  "narrative": [
    "TimeForSalahWebsite demonstrates a straightforward approach to presenting daily prayer times in the browser. It relies on adhan-js for high precision calculations and moment-timezone for formatting.",
    "The site is live, but the repository shows minimal activity since 2021. There are several unmerged dependency PRs and no issues or releases.",
    "With a license, better documentation, and a minimal contribution process, this project could become a friendly starter for students and community developers."
