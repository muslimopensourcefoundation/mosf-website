  "summary": "A widely reused, truly open Qur'an API (Unlicense) serving 90+ languages and 400+ translations. Its CDN-first JSON design makes integration trivial and resilient for educational and production use.",
  "narrative": [
    "The project distributes Qur'an data via jsDelivr with a clear REST-like URL pattern, enabling developers and educators to fetch chapters, verses, info, and fonts without authentication or rate limits.",
    "Breadth matters here: 90+ languages and 400+ translations make this API a unique public resource for the global Muslim community.",
    "Formalizing an OpenAPI spec, lightweight governance (how editions are vetted/updated), and a periodic changelog would make downstream adoption even smoother."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Publish an OpenAPI (Swagger) spec and link it from the README.",
    "Add issue/PR templates, labels, and a brief governance note (edition criteria and update flow).",
    "Provide a periodic CHANGELOG and consider semantic tags for data snapshots."
