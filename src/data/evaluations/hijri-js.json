  "summary": "Hijri.js is a standalone JavaScript library for converting between Gregorian and Hijri dates. It addresses accuracy issues with historical dates and operates without database dependencies. While technically sound and clearly licensed (MIT), the repository shows minimal maintenance activity and lacks community governance structures.",
  "narrative": [
    "The library was created to solve a specific problem: existing Hijri converters were either inaccurate (especially for dates before 1420H) or required database lookups. Hijri.js provides a pure JavaScript solution that can be embedded directly in web pages.",
    "The implementation is straightforward and functional, with clear conversion methods and date formatting options. The MIT license enables broad reuse, making it suitable for both commercial and non-commercial Islamic applications.",
    "However, the repository shows signs of dormancy. With only 9 commits and no recent activity, the project appears to be in maintenance mode rather than active development. The lack of governance documentation limits its potential for community contributions."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and issue/PR templates to encourage community participation.",
    "Expand documentation with installation instructions (npm/CDN), API reference, browser compatibility, and examples for common use cases.",
    "Consider publishing to npm for easier distribution and dependency management.",
    "Add unit tests and CI/CD to ensure accuracy and maintainability.",
    "Tag releases with version numbers and maintain a CHANGELOG to track changes.",
    "Consider adding TypeScript definitions for better developer experience."
