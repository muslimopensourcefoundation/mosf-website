  "summary": "A straightforward Qur'an reader spanning many languages via an external Quran API. With an explicit license, contributor docs, and a small release cadence, it could move closer to Model status.",
  "narrative": [
    "The project offers a simple, shareable way to read the Qur'an and jump to chapters/verses or specify editions via URL parameters, which makes it learner-friendly and easy to embed in lessons.",
    "Its reliance on a separate Free Quran API keeps this repo lightweight; clarifying attribution and licensing would improve reuse and institutional adoption.",
    "Introducing basic governance files and a predictable update rhythm would encourage outside contributions and signal ongoing stewardship."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add a LICENSE file (MIT/BSD/Unlicense) and include brief attribution to the Quran API and edition sources.",
    "Add CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and issue/PR templates (bug, new edition request, feature).",
    "Tag periodic releases and keep a short CHANGELOG.",
    "Expand documentation with local setup/build and an accessibility checklist (keyboard, contrast, screen reader, RTL)."
