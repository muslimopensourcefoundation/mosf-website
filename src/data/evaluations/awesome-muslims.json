  "summary": "A widely starred curated list of Muslim/Islamic open-source resources that meaningfully advances discovery and education. With a clear license and basic contributor governance, it could approach Model status.",
  "narrative": [
    "Awesome-Muslims serves as a central index for Muslim-oriented open-source projects, making it easier for learners, educators, and developers to find useful tools.",
    "Its curated breadth is the value: Quran tools, prayer-time libraries, mobile apps, APIs, and more, organized for quick scanning and exploration.",
    "The next step is curation maturity: a clear content license, contributor guide, code of conduct, templates for link submissions, and light automation (dead link checks) to sustain quality."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add an explicit license (e.g., CC0-1.0 or CC-BY-4.0) and a reuse statement in README.",
    "Add CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md; create templates for 'Add resource' and 'Dead link' issues.",
    "Automate link checking weekly via CI; add 'dead-link' and 'new-entry' labels for triage.",
    "Provide a short submission guide (what qualifies, faith-alignment rules).",
    "Optional: publish a monthly CHANGELOG or Releases notes summarizing new additions."
