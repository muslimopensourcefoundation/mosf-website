  "summary": "A simple static Qur'an reader in Arabic hosted on GitHub Pages. Without a license, documentation, and recent maintenance, it remains a useful demo but not a reusable open-source project.",
  "narrative": [
    "This project provides a fast, minimal Arabic Qur'an reading experience as a static site. It demonstrates a straightforward build that can serve users without a backend.",
    "However, the repository has seen no development activity since 2018 and lacks documentation and licensing, which limits community reuse and contributions.",
    "Adding a permissive license, basic docs, and minimal governance would lift it into the Aligned range and make it easier for others to adopt or extend."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add a LICENSE file (MIT or BSD-3-Clause).",
    "Create a README with local setup, build, and deploy steps.",
    "Add CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and simple issue or PR templates.",
    "Publish a small accessibility checklist and tag a release with a short CHANGELOG.",
    "If the project is complete and intentionally inactive, note archival status and link to active readers."
